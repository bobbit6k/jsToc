# The "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" License (ICBINBL)

Version 1.0, March 2024

**Congratulations!** By opting to use this slice of code, you've officially embraced the ethos of "work smarter, not harder," and have stumbled upon the ICBINBL, a license that's as unconventional as it is binding. Here's what you need to know:

## PERMISSIONS

1. **Freedom to Frolic**: You are hereby granted the unencumbered right to do literally whatever your heart desires with this code. Fork it, transform it, or dress it up in a tutu and call it Shirley - your imagination is the only limit.

2. **Admission of Laziness**: By utilizing this code, you tacitly admit to being lazier than the author (who, for the record, is quite proud of finding the most efficient route to victory). This isn't a fault; in the realm of coding, it's a superpower. Welcome to the club.

3. **Mandatory Merriment**: As you journey forth with this code, you are obligated to enjoy the process. If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong. Laugh at your bugs, cheer on your successes, and remember: it's only code.

## CONDITIONS

- **Credit Where Credit's Due (Or Not)**: While not mandatory, a shoutout to the original author or a nod in the README would be much appreciated. It's like tipping your server; not legally required, but good karma. And if you don't want credit, feel free to miscredit (just for laughs).

- **Share-Alike**: If you remix, transform, or build upon this code, you don't have to distribute your contributions under the same license. After all, freedom means writing your own rules.

- **Use At Your Own Risk**: This code comes as-is, with no guarantees of functionality, security, or fitness for any purpose. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

## DISCLAIMERS

1. **Not Responsible for Overuse Injuries**: If you find this code so enjoyable that you can't stop coding, we're flattered, but we're not liable for the ensuing carpal tunnel.

2. **May Contain Traces of Humor**: If you're allergic to puns, sarcasm, or dad jokes, proceed with caution.

Remember, the best code is the code that's shared. Enjoy the ride, and may your console always be error-free.
